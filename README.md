Nova Physics is a lightweight and easy to use 2D physics engine.
</p>



# Features
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Rigid body dynamics
- Primitive shape collisions (circle, rect, polygon, AABB)
- Physical material properties (friction, restitution and density)
- Joint constraints (spring, distance, ...)
- Iterative sequential impulse solver
- Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler integrator
- Collision event callbacks
- Sleeping bodies to reduce CPU load
- Attractive forces
- Portable codebase with no dependencies
- Various examples using SDL2



# Roadmap & Future
Nova Physics is still in its early stages as in `0.x.x` versions. There is a large room of improvement and optimization of the API and engine's itself. Here are some important points that needs a touch before reaching the `1.x.x` milestone:

- ### Faster broad-phase
  Current broad-phase strategy is a spatial hash grid, which works well in lots of cases, however supporting a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy tree) can be a good target for developers to choose for their own simulation needs.

- ### Stability & Optimization
  Other than a faster broad-phase, I will be working on general optimizations and refactoring the codebase. SIMD support and a multithreaded solver is also in the schedule but has low priority for obvious reasons.

- ### Python Binding
  Nova Physics's Python module ([here](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics-python)) is still WIP. I plan it to have an easy-to-use Pythonic interface. Other language binding contributions are also always welcome!



# Installing & Building
Nova Phyiscs is lightweight and portable, using only C standard library.
<br><br>
Development libraries are always shipped with the most recent release under the name of `nova-physics-X.X.X-devel.zip` or `.tar.gz`. You can download the archive [here](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics/releases) and link `libnova.a` with your favorite compiler to use Nova Physics in your project.
<br><br>
But if you want (*or need*) to build Nova Physics from scratch on your own, use [the building guide](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics/blob/main/BUILDING.md#building-nova-physics-library).
